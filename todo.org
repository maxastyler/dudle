* Change the game parts, and refactor into smaller modules
  The game_live and game_server parts should just care about events, and not have much logic inside their event
  handling functions. They should just call out to the smaller modules.
  Eg, have a Play module, which contains the functions for modifying the play state, eg. adding submissions to the rounds, etc...
  The things which should be broadcast are changes in rounds, all submissions, things like that.
  Players should then call the genserver which will give them their respective state.
  Player tracking should be done through presence still.

  The largest part of broadcasting will be done when revealing the submissions.

  Have smaller liveviews (components) for the different parts of the game state.
